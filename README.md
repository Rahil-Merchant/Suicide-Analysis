# Suicide-Analysis

To determine the factors that influence suicide rates the most, we analyse datasets containing
information from 1985 to 2013 on various parameters that could possibly have an effect on
suicide rates. We intend to create visualizations that better illustrate the large amounts of data
and conduct exploratory data analysis. We also try to correlate different factors with the
dependent variable (number of suicides) and use these correlative variables to create predictive
models. We then evaluate these models to identify the most effective ones. These models can
then be used to predict the number of suicides in a year based on the values of correlative
variables. Also, a case study on the correlation of the Greek economy crisis with the number of suicides is conducted.
